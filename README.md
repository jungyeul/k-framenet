    abstract = "Previous research on Korean FrameNet has produced several datasets that serve as resources for FrameNet parsing in Korean. However, these datasets suffer from the problem that annotations are assigned on the word level, which is not optimally designed based on the agglutinative feature of Korean. To address this issue, we introduce a morphologically enhanced annotation strategy for Korean FrameNet datasets and parsing by leveraging the CoNLL-U format. We present the results of the FrameNet parsers trained on the Korean FrameNet data in the original format and our proposed format, respectively, and further elaborate on the linguistic rationales of our proposed scheme. We suggest the morpheme-based scheme to be the standard of Korean FrameNet data annotation.",
